I created this project in 12th grade with a friend of mine.
attached and accessible from within the web app is a pdf that explains both the code and acts as a user manual.

In short - this, if used correctly to mirror the minesweeper board, will massively increase your chances of winning at minesweeper.

at the time of building it, we researched online on different ways of solving the game, and applied them within the code.


note, code quality is quite bad, this will probably refactored to hell and be redesigned once I have time.
still works though, pretty cool for a first big project.
